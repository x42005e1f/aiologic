aiologic
========

**aiologic** is an async-aware library for tasks synchronization and their
communication in different threads and different event loops. Let's take a look
at the example:

.. code:: python

    import time

    from threading import Thread, get_ident

    import anyio

    from aiologic import Lock

    lock = Lock()
    start = time.monotonic()


    async def func():
        print(
            f"{time.monotonic() - start:.0f}:",
            f"thread={get_ident()}",
            f"task={anyio.get_current_task().id}",
            'start',
        )

        async with lock:
            await anyio.sleep(1)

        print(
            f"{time.monotonic() - start:.0f}:",
            f"thread={get_ident()}",
            f"task={anyio.get_current_task().id}",
            'stop',
        )


    async def main():
        async with anyio.create_task_group() as tasks:
            for _ in range(2):
                tasks.start_soon(func)


    for _ in range(2):
        Thread(target=anyio.run, args=[main]).start()

It prints something like this:

.. code-block::

    0: thread=140011620005632 task=140011624407888 start
    0: thread=140011611612928 task=140011602572720 start
    0: thread=140011620005632 task=140011624408560 start
    0: thread=140011611612928 task=140011602574512 start
    1: thread=140011620005632 task=140011624407888 stop
    2: thread=140011611612928 task=140011602572720 stop
    3: thread=140011620005632 task=140011624408560 stop
    4: thread=140011611612928 task=140011602574512 stop

As you can see, when using `aiologic.Lock`, tasks from different event loops
are all able to acquire a lock. In the same case if you use `anyio.Lock`, it
will raise a `RuntimeError`. And `threading.Lock` will cause a deadlock.

Features
========

* Python 3.8+ support
* `CPython <https://www.python.org/>`_ and `PyPy <https://pypy.org/>`_ support
* Cancellation and timeouts support
* Optional `Trio-style checkpoints
  <https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference-core.html#checkpoints>`_:

  * enabled by default for Trio itself
  * disabled by default for all others

* Only one checkpoint per asynchronous call:

  * exactly one context switch if checkpoints are enabled
  * zero or one context switch if checkpoints are disabled

* Fairness wherever possible (with some caveats)
* Thread safety wherever possible

Synchronization primitives:

* Semaphores: counting and bounded
* Locks: primitive and reentrant
* Conditions
* Events: one-time and reusable
* Resource guards
* Queues: simple only

Supported concurrency libraries:

* `asyncio <https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html>`_
  and `trio <https://trio.readthedocs.io>`_ (coroutine-based)
* `eventlet <https://eventlet.readthedocs.io>`_
  and `gevent <https://www.gevent.org/>`_ (greenlet-based)

All synchronization primitives are implemented entirely on effectively atomic
operations, which gives `an incredible speedup on PyPy
<https://gist.github.com/x42005e1f/149d3994d5f7bd878def71d5404e6ea4>`_ compared
to alternatives from the threading module. All this works because of GIL, but
per-object locks also ensure that `the same operations are still atomic
<https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/#container-thread-safety>`_, so aiologic also
works when running in a `free-threaded mode
<https://docs.python.org/3.13/whatsnew/3.13.html#free-threaded-cpython>`_.
