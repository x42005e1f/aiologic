Performance
===========

You probably came here to see how fast aiologic is. To see detailed
measurements, beautifully drawn with `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`__,
such as in `the reply to one issue <https://github.com/x42005e1f/aiologic/
issues/7#issuecomment-3067270072>`__. Well, try to come back another time!

The purpose of this section is to show how deep the rabbit hole in which
aiologic has burrowed goes. Just as with great power comes great
responsibility, with great opportunity comes great challenges that you are not
aware of.

A world full of squares
-----------------------

When working with threading, programmers usually do not think about how
everything works under the hood. They rely on the OS-level scheduler to create
good visibility of parallel execution and treat it as a black box. But
abstractions leak when it comes to the execution time of your code.

Meet the square
+++++++++++++++

Suppose we want to start :math:`n` threads to perform some long work. Whether
it is for parallel computing with `NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`__ arrays, for
network operations, or for simulating some game processes - it does not matter.
Here is an example that allows us to estimate the time spent on performing a
full start of all threads:

.. code:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python3

    import sys
    import threading
    import time


    def main():
        n = int(sys.argv[1])  # the number of threads
        count = [None] * n  # as a thread-safe counter

        def work():
            count.pop()  # decrement

            while count:  # wait for the other threads
                time.sleep(0)  # do some work

        threads = [threading.Thread(target=work) for _ in range(n)]
        start_time = time.perf_counter()

        for thread in threads:  # start all threads
            thread.start()

        for thread in threads:  # join all threads
            thread.join()

        print(time.perf_counter() - start_time)  # elapsed time in seconds


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        sys.exit(main())

In this example, we take the first command-line argument as :math:`n`. We start
the threads, and each one performs its work (emulates system calls) until all
of them are started, which we control using the list as a thread-safe counter.

.. note::

    You can replace ``time.sleep(0)`` with ``pass`` to emulate CPU load, but
    this is not recommended. In this case, the thread will not yield control
    until it has spent its timeslice (5 milliseconds by default; you can change
    it via :func:`sys.setswitchinterval`). This will result in seconds of real
    time even with a small number of threads, with a large spread, which is not
    suitable for estimation.

    Either way, system call emulation gives the same interpretation as you can
    get with CPU load.

Below the code, you can see the measurements. They were taken on a laptop
running Linux with a dual-core processor. One minute was allocated for each
:math:`n` (the code was run multiple times within one minute), and the median
was taken as the final time.

Let us interpret the results. Increasing the number of threads by :math:`k`
times increases the time of a full start by :math:`k^2` times: 100 → 200 gives
a factor of 4 (:math:`=2^2`), 100 → 300 gives a factor of 9 (:math:`=3^2`), and
so on. Thus, we can clearly see that the dependence of the time of a full start
on the number of threads is not linear — in fact, it is quadratic. But why does
this happen?

When you start a thread in Python, two operations are performed under the hood:

1. The interpreter asks the operating system to start the thread (see the
   :mod:`_thread` module).
2. The implementation of :meth:`threading.Thread.start` waits for the thread to
   notify that it has started.

Thus, calling :meth:`threading.Thread.start` effectively forces the main thread
in our example to do a context switch (since it must be notified by the
thread). And since the operating system needs to emulate the concurrent
execution of all threads, the whole thing does not look like ping-pong between
the main thread and the newly started thread - the operating system also needs
to allocate CPU resources to the already running threads.

If we look at the order in which context switching occurs on each pass of the
scheduler, we will see something like this (where thread #0 is the main
thread):

* ``±thread #0`` (starting the first thread)
* ``+thread #1`` (running one thread)
* ``±thread #0 → thread #1`` (starting the second thread)
* ``+thread #2 → thread #1`` (running two threads)
* ``±thread #0 → thread #2 → thread #1`` (starting the third thread)
* ``+thread #3 → thread #2 → thread #1`` (running three threads)
* ...
* ``±thread #0 → thread #(N-1) → ... → thread #1`` (starting the last thread)
* ``±thread #(N) → -thread #(N-1) → ... → -thread #1`` (stopping all threads)
* ``±thread #0`` (the end)

In particular, for :math:`n=1`:

* ``±thread #0`` (starting the first/last thread)
* ``±thread #1`` (stopping all threads)
* ``±thread #0`` (the end)

For :math:`n=3`:

* ``±thread #0`` (starting the first thread)
* ``+thread #1`` (running one thread)
* ``±thread #0 → thread #1`` (starting the second thread)
* ``+thread #2 → thread #1`` (running two threads)
* ``±thread #0 → thread #2 → thread #1`` (starting the third thread)
* ``±thread #3 → -thread #2 → -thread #1`` (stopping all threads)
* ``±thread #0`` (the end)

With each new thread, the required number of context switches to start the next
one increases. We see two triangles (:math:`1+1+2+2+3+3+…+n+n`
:math:`=2(1+2+3+…+n)` context switches until the end), which become one
*square* when the constants is discarded (:math:`2(1+2+3+…+n)+1`
:math:`=2\frac{n(1+n)}{2}+1` :math:`=n(1+n)+1` :math:`⇒n(n)` :math:`=n^2`) -
that is where the quadratic `time complexity <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Time_complexity>`__ comes from!

Our example is not the only one with the square. There are others, also scarily
simple and reproducible. But let us now express the time complexity using `big
O notation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation>`__ for simplicity.
From this point on, "square" and :math:`O(n^2)` are synonymous.

Squares, squares everywhere
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Suppose we use mutual exclusion to provide exclusive access to a shared state.
We have :math:`n` threads that first synchronize via a lock, aka a mutex, and
then do some work until each thread gains access to the shared state. And by
some coincidence, each thread (except the first one) waited on the lock.

.. code:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python3

    import sys
    import threading
    import time


    def main():
        n = int(sys.argv[1])  # the number of threads
        count = []  # as a thread-safe counter
        start_time = None
        lock = threading.Lock()

        def work():
            nonlocal start_time

            count.append(None)  # increment

            with lock:
                if start_time is None:  # the first thread
                    while len(count) < n:  # wait for the other threads
                        time.sleep(0)  # (via polling)

                    start_time = time.perf_counter()

            count.pop()  # decrement

            while count:  # wait for the other threads
                time.sleep(0)  # do some work

        threads = [threading.Thread(target=work) for _ in range(n)]

        for thread in threads:  # start all threads
            thread.start()

        for thread in threads:  # join all threads
            thread.join()

        print(time.perf_counter() - start_time)  # elapsed time in seconds


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        sys.exit(main())

.. note::

    The code above does not guarantee that all threads will actually be in the
    lock's waiting queue. In fact, a thread may do a context switch after the
    increment but before attempting to acquire the lock. However, it is
    extremely unlikely that it will not have time to join the waiting queue, so
    this fact does not affect the results.

    It is possible to provide such a guarantee using one of the aiologic
    primitives and their :attr:`~aiologic.Lock.waiting` property, but this
    approach would not inspire the same trust as using standard primitives,
    would it?

Well, :math:`O(n^2)` again! And this is quite expected.

On each pass of the scheduler, one :meth:`~threading.Lock.release()` call is
made. This means that on the next pass, the number of running threads will be
increased by one. The remaining threads cannot wake up until future passes, as
they are still queued. And at the same time, the operating system still
allocates CPU resources to the running threads.

* ...
* ``+thread #1`` (running one thread)
* ``+thread #2 → thread #1`` (running two threads)
* ``+thread #3 → thread #2 → thread #1`` (running three threads)
* ...
* ``±thread #(N) → -thread #(N-1) → ... → -thread #1`` (stopping all threads)
* ...

In particular, for :math:`n=1`:

* ...
* ``±thread #1`` (stopping all threads)
* ...

For :math:`n=3`:

* ...
* ``+thread #1`` (running one thread)
* ``+thread #2 → thread #1`` (running two threads)
* ``±thread #3 → -thread #2 → -thread #1`` (stopping all threads)
* ...

This is a very obvious triangle, which becomes half of one square, and
therefore gives :math:`O(n^2)`: :math:`1+2+3+…+n` :math:`=\frac{n(1+n)}{2}`
:math:`⇒n(n)` :math:`=n^2`.

Okay, we have examined two simple but important examples. It will now become
clear why.

In the first case, we addressed the topic of waking up multiple threads.
Despite its simplicity, its interpretation also applies to any other similar
case, such as multiple :meth:`condition.notify() <threading.Condition.notify>`,
:meth:`semaphore.release() <threading.Semaphore.release>`, or even just
:meth:`lock.release() <threading.Lock.release>`! Waiting for one queue by
multiple threads also suffers from the squares problem.

In the second case, we addressed the topic of mutual exclusion. You know how
ubiquitous it is; you can encounter it in almost any multithreaded application.
In fact, all standard threading primitives are implemented on top of
:class:`threading.Lock`! The world you know is poisoned by a dark army of
squares...

But how close are we to the truth?

The square is (not) a lie
